## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
   GEMINI_API_KEY=""
   MONGODB_URI=""
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="2830f4d3f72508da493319689rf818b348d600986f60506550c39622e4629d65"
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=""
   ```

   - **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID** and **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Obtain these from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
   - **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Obtain this from your Google AI Studio account.
   - **MONGODB_URI**: Your MongoDB connection string.
   - **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: A random string used by NextAuth.js to encrypt sessions.
   - **YOUTUBE_API_KEY**: Your YouTube Data API key (optional if you plan to integrate YouTube data).

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized build in the `.next` folder. You can then start the production server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

### Deployment

You can deploy the application on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting service that supports Next.js. Make sure to set the environment variables in your hosting platform's dashboard.
